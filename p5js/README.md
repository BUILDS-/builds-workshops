To get started, you're going to want to open the [p5.js Web Editor](https://editor.p5js.org/) 
and the [p5.js Reference](https://p5js.org/reference/)

Possible options for a workshop:
- Make your own pet shape
- Make a flower
- Make something abstract

## How the setup and draw functions work
setup() is called once, during the setup
draw() is called as many times per second as possible, this means that
on some machines, the draw function is called at a slower rate. Draw can 
be thought of as the frame rate. This is important to remember for when you 
are changing variables based on this funciton!
