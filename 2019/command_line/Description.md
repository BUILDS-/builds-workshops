# Intro to Command Line

Not sure what the command line is?

Think you're a pro and want to increase your skills by learning tmux, bash_profile aliases and alternate shells?

This workshop is for you. We're going to start out by going over the very basics of the command line and then we're going to show you how to get to the next level.

Come if your only knowledge of the command line is http://hackertyper.net/ or if you ssh into your aws machine and attach to a tmux session. Everyone will learn something.
