# Using API's workshop

You can't go programming without knowing how to use and make a reliable API. If you go anywhere within tech, one way or another, you'll bump into an API!

BUILDS is hosting a workshop on how to use API's. We will cover the handy basics of restful API's and how to use them. 

Especially if you have not used API's often or want to brush up on the real world usefulness of using API's, this workshop is for you. 

API's give programmatic access to powerful services hosted by third parties. 

These days, APIs are especially important because they dictate how developers can create new apps that tap into big Web servicesâ€”social networks like Facebook or Pinterest, for instance, or utilities like Google Maps or Dropbox. 

We'll have Sean Smith teach this workshop, so be sure to stop by MCS B33, this Wednesday, March 4, 7:00 PM.
