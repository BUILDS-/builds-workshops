# How to Git (Workshop)

Github is one of the most useful tools when it comes to seeking employment, collaborating with peers, and, of course, version control. If you've never used Git before, this will be an excellent opportunity!

I urge all of you to come, but I will put documentation together so that absent people will still be able to see what we did :)
