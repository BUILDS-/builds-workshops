# Alexa Skills Development Workshop

First everyone needs to sign up for an AWS account. The easiest way to do so for students is to sign up for the [Github Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack).

If you're not a student or don't want free AWS credit, make an AWS account [here](https://aws.amazon.com/). To do so you'll need a credit card (which you don't need if you use the github pack).
