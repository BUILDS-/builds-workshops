# AWS Workshop
The term the "cloud" gets thrown around a lot these days. Amazon Web Services is the leading cloud provider. The cloud allows you to host a website, run the backend of an application and a myriad of other exciting things. 

Computing as a service is the way most new technology companies run their servers. It's a great thing to put on your resume and a lot of fun to play around with.

Come and get your own virtual server setup for free!
