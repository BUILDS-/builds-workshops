### What is Bitcoin?

In non-technical language, Bitcoin is a digital currency in which transactions can be performed without the need for a credit card or central bank. It's designed to enable users to send money over the Internet in a very simple and efficient way.

Bitcoin is comprised of two parts, the wallet and the blockchain.

### The Wallet

The wallet is like your debit card, it contains a unique public key (like a credit card number) and a secret key. It also contains the transactions you've made, it does not store a balance, the balance is a sum of the transactions made with that wallet.

Here is a private key in hexadecimal - 256 bits in hexadecimal is 32 bytes, or 64 characters in the range 0-9 or A-F.
