# Raspberry Pi Game Console Workshop

### What is the Raspberry Pi?

"*The Raspberry Pi is a low cost, credit-card sized computer that plugs into a computer monitor or TV, and uses a standard keyboard and mouse.*"

### What we're doing Today
Like the title describes, we're going to be turning our Pis into fully functional emulators (for over [40 different platforms](https://github.com/RetroPie/RetroPie-Setup/blob/master/platforms.cfg))!

### Configuration
The Software that we're going to use is called [Retropie](https://github.com/RetroPie/RetroPie-Setup).

Two awesome installation guides for reference:
